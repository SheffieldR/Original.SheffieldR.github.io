This month's talks cover ensembles in machine learning and using R notebooks as a learning tool.

**"Wisdom of the crowd": Ensembles in machine learning, and the factors that influence them**

Pieter Wessels will present a brief discussion on Ensembles, including popular algorithms for creating same engine Ensembles (bagging, boosting, etc), multiple engine Ensembles, the factors that influence Ensembles, including diversity between members and a brief introduction to one measure of diversity.

**Teaching with R Notebooks**

Duncan Gillespie will speak about the pros and cons of using R notebooks as a learning tool in an introductory R course.

We hope to see you there!

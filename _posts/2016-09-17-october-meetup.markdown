At this month's meeting we'll be talking about how R interacts with different languages and technologies.

Our very own Mat Hall will give us a crash course in using R with Jupyter notebooks for interactive reproducible and collaborative research.

We'll also hear from Mike Croucher, who is an EPSRC Research Software Engineering Fellow working at The University of Sheffield. Mike specialises in assisting researchers to produce better quality software. He is co-founder of The University of Sheffield's Research Software Engineering group and plays a major role in the Sheffield Open Data Science Initiative. In September Mike was involved in organising the first ever Research Software Engineering conference. 

We look forward to seeing you there!

The SheffieldR team

Mark Dunning (Twitter: @DrMarkDunning) will give a general introduction to the Docker container platform and present a couple of R-related examples in which he used it to distribute course materials and supplementary materials for a paper. Mark joined Sheffield University in October 2017 to set up a Bioinformatics Core facility, having previously worked for Cancer Research UK in Cambridge after completing his PhD. The Sheffield Bioinformatics Core (http://sbc.shef.ac.uk) provides support on the analysis and interpretation of biological datasets as well as a programme of training courses. Mark is an R and open-science enthusiast and has contributed software to the popular Bioconductor project and developed and delivered numerous training courses on R.

Phil Mike Jones (Twitter: @philmikejones) will talk us through some interactive unit testing using examples from his package, rakeR (https://github.com/philmikejones/rakeR/tree/master/tests), and his reproducible PhD thesis (https://github.com/philmikejones/thesis/tree/master/data-raw).
Phil is a research associate in the Centre for Criminological Research based in the School of Law at the University of Sheffield, working on the “Long-term impacts of ‘Thatcherism’: crime, politics and inequality” project. He has just finished a PhD in human geography at the University of Sheffield, entitled ‘A Spatial Microsimulation Analysis of Health Inequalities and Health Resilience’.

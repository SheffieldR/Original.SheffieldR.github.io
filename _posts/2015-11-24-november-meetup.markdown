This month we are delighted to welcome a guest speaker Matt Aldridge from Mango Solutions - a company which specialises in data analysis/science, training and consultancy using R. You may know them as they organise the Effective Applications of the R Language (EARL) conferences in the UK and US. Matt's talk will be titled "The Changing Face of R" and will be accessible to all regardless of experience or background - it will certainly be interesting in how R is being used to shape data analysis away from the academic ivory tower!

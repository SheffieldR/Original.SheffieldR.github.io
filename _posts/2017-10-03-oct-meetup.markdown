It’s [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) over on GitHub! a global celebration of open source intended to promote participation in open source projects.

So this month we're taking a break from talks and booked some group hackspaces at the University throughout the month to **get involved in some open source projects requiring some #rstats help.**

Anyone can benefit from getting involved, regardless of coding skill. At the very least, you’ll **learn more about open source** and **how to contribute through online collaborative coding platforms like GitHub**. But you never know, you might end up stumbling across the perfect project for you and ending up joining a community.

You can choose to contribute as little or much as you like, from correcting typos, contributing ideas to discussions to building features! Make at least 4 contributions (pull requests) to any GitHub-hosted project between October 1 and October 31 to **earn a limited edition Hacktoberfest T-shirt!**


**At today's meetup:**

We'll take a look at [Hacktoberfest R projects on GitHub](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3Ahacktoberfest+state%3Aopen+type%3Aissue+language%3AR&type=) (many [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) packages requiring help!) and discuss how to use GitHub to contribute to projects e.g. how to make a pull request, best practice for contributing code etc.

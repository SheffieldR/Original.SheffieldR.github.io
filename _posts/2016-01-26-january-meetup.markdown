This month we will be talking in more detail about our upcoming NBN Biodiversity Hack event, which will be held over the first 3 weeks of March. Paul and Anna will share some of our experiences from the Open Data Sheffield #hackthemarine event held earlier this month, and we will bounce around any ideas the group may have for exciting analyses and visualisations using the biodiversity data.

But that's not all! We are delighted to have a talk from Dan Pollard from UoS Health Economics and Decision Science. He will be introducing the Zelig package, which can be used to both estimate statistical models but also conduct simulations from the results; ideal for building data driven computer models.

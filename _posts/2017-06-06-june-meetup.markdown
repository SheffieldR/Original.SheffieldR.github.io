This month Anna Krystalli will present a exploration of literate programming, following up from a discussion on literate programming techniques at our meetup in April, and Pete Dodd will tell us about building an open source decision tree package in R.

**Literate programming with Rmarkdown**

In this session we'll explore the various options and strategies for literate programming and dynamic report generation in R and Rmarkdown. This session will make use of the literate programming packages knitr and rmarkdown.

**Writing a decision tree package for R**

Decision trees are a class of model widely used in health economic modelling. A tree (in the mathematical sense) has probabilities associated with branches leaving a node to describe the chances of a set of potential outcomes. In health economics, costs and health consequences are also associated with outcomes. By way of example, clinical diagnostic algorithms based on a sequence of symptom screens and diagnostic tests map particularly naturally into this framework. There are proprietary packages to develop, visualize and analyse such models, but nothing open-source and user-friendly. We describe an attempt to develop a package with a simple syntax for decision tree models in R based on the DOT language, which allows visualization, as well as considerable flexibility in analysis approach.

We hope to see you there!

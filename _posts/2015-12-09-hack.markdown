In March 2016, we'll be running a hackathon event over several sessions. The hack will focus on the [National Biodiversity Network](http://www.nbn.org.uk)'s data to collaboratively develop outputs that benefit the public, Council or local wildlife organisations.

The event is open to all, whether you're an R expert or just interested in using R. No experience in R or biology is needed, just turn up and we'll help you get started with the [`rnbn`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rnbn/index.html) package. You'll learn more about R along the way, and maybe see some packages or other technologies you might not be familiar with that will be useful in your own projects.

We'll be using GitHub to facilitate the hack so you'll also gain some experience in using Git to collaborate and share reproducible analyses. You'll be able to network with other local R users and collaborate with them to produce something awesome. You'll also be able to explore the potential of resources on the open web to build insight, services and education.  Best of all, lunch will be provided at the kick-off event!

You can [register your interest in the event here](http://bit.ly/1RWxJ7l). We'll open registration for the event in early January. To get updates on the hack and our events, follow us on Twitter: [@Sheffield\_R\_](https://twitter.com/Sheffield_R_).

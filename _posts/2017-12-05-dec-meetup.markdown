In the run up to the festive season we'd like to invite Sheffield R users to come and join us for an R coding social! Come along for a chance to meet and greet fellow R users in Sheffield. If you have a coding problem to discuss, feel free to bring it along and take advantage of the wealth of R coding knowledge available!

We’ll start with a round of introductions, allowing people briefly to introduce themselves. After going around the room, there will be the opportunity for attendees to share code they've been working on and want help with / want feedback on / want to present.

Come with a topic you want to discuss or with something you’ve done that you want to tell everyone about, or just come to listen and contribute as much or as little as you want.

We're running a hackathon event over three sessions in March. The hack will focus on the [National Biodiversity Network](http://www.nbn.org.uk)'s data to collaboratively develop outputs that benefit the public, Council or local wildlife organisations.

See the [Hack details page](/nbn-hack/) for details on the event including how to register. To get updates on the hack and our events, follow us on Twitter: [@Sheffield\_R\_](https://twitter.com/Sheffield_R_).

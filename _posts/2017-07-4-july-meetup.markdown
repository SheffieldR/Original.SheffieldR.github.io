We've got two great talks lined up for our last meeting before the summer break. 

**Rebecca Senior** is a 3rd year PhD student in the Department of Animal and Plant Sciences at the University of Sheffield, and avid lover of using R to do just about everything! She studies interactions between land-use change and climate change in the tropics. She’s going to talk about the work she’s been doing analysing thermal image data collected in the forests of Borneo. 

**Chris Hopkinson** is a Sheffield R group regular, analyst and data lover. He’ll be giving us the low-down on object oriented systems in R.

### Thermal images in R

Rebecca will introduce the ThermImage package and demonstrate its use in extracting and processing thermal images in R. She'll talk about the challenges associated with the structure of thermal data and the kinds of questions that ecologists can ask with such data, such as capturing the extent to which animals can move locally to track their preferred temperatures. A single thermal image produces 19,200 distinct temperature measurements, so optimising the extraction -> processing -> plotting -> analysis workflow is essential.

### Object oriented systems in R

Object Oriented programming is commonplace in many languages. It is a useful way to organise code. R has some special flavours of Object Oriented programming. Understanding these will help you understand R better and write better software.

We hope to see you there!

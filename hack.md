title: SheffieldR NBN Hack
permalink: /nbn-hack/

In March 2016, we'll be running a hackathon event over three sessions. The hack will focus on the [National Biodiversity Network](http://www.nbn.org.uk)'s data to collaboratively develop outputs that benefit the public, Council or local wildlife organisations.

The events are open to all, whether you're an R expert or just interested in using R. No experience in R or biology is needed, just turn up and we'll help you get started with the [`rnbn`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rnbn/index.html) package. You'll learn more about R along the way, and maybe see some packages or other technologies you might not be familiar with that will be useful in your own projects. This is also a great opportunity to acquire and develop your open science skills that you could apply beyond the NBN data set alone.

To get everyone started with the NBN data set, we've created a short analysis using Jupyter that shows [how easy it is](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mathew-hall/SheffieldR/blob/master/NBN/NBN.ipynb)!

## What we're aiming for

Our aims for the event are to bring the University together with other practitioners in the local area to learn more about R and share experience and do good for Sheffield by supporting the [Sheffield Wildlife Trust](http://www.wildsheffield.com) by focusing on biodiversity data for Sheffield.

Our overall philosophy is; **"no pressure, just learn and code for fun!"**.

## Event details

The events will all take place in the [Sheffield Methods Institute](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/smi) [\[Map\]](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/53°22'52.0%22N+1°28'54.2%22W/@53.381103,-1.48173,18z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x0).
